I am taking new PhD students! **Send questions or CV to D.Makowski@sussex.ac.uk**.

## What you will get

- Join a young and dynamic team with a vibrant lab life
- A supervisor that actually supervises ðŸ¤¯
- A super interesting research topic

## How to do a PhD in Psychology?

1. The first step is usually to contact the potential supervisor to discuss a rough research project outline. Write an email with your CV, your research interests and - if you have - some ideas for a research project that matches your supervisor's line of research. If you **don't have ideas yet**, it's perfectly fine! I will likely propose some avenues of research that might match your interest, and refine that down the line.
2. Once you have an in-principle approval, the next step is to get **funding**. There are usually 3 types of profiles: 1) the student and the supervisor come up with a research project, with which the student then applies to get some scholarship: 2) the supervisor already has a scholarship for a specific project that he obtained a grant for, and will recruit a PhD for that research project; 3) the student already secured a scholarship that allows them to pursue a PhD with the supervisor of their choice. However, funding is a tough topic, with many other possibilities and case-by-case considerations. Here are some opportunities:
- The [**Sussex Psychology Doctoral Research Studentship**](https://archive.sussex.ac.uk/study/scholarships/1525-Psychology-Doctoral-Research-Studentship-UK-and-International) (UK and international students)
- The [**South East Network of Social Scientists (SeNSS)**](https://senss-dtp.ac.uk/apply) (UK and international students)
- The [**South Coast Biosciences Network (SoCoBio)**](https://southcoastdtp.ac.uk/funding/) (UK and international students)
- The [**Sussex Neuroscience 4-years PhD**](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-neuroscience/phd/4yearphd) (UK and international students)
- The [**Joint China Scholarship**](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/fees-funding/phd-funding/view/1539-China-Scholarship-Council-CSC-University-of-Sussex-Joint-Scholarships-2023) (China)
- If an external partner agrees to cover half the cost (approx. Â£35k over three years), the university could match the other half of the cost. Useful for applied projects and collaborations with startups, private companies or NGOs.

## Clinical Psychology PhD or DClinPsy

Unfortunately, the University of Sussex does not offer at the moment a PhD in ***Clinical Psychology*** that contains clinical placements and internships. However, if you are interested in working with patients, it is entirely possible to have a research project that involves clinical populations, and specialize in "clinical" research. Some people then complement this kind of PhD with clinical trainings (e.g., psychotherapy) to transition from research to practice.

## How to become a Neuropsychologist?

Neuropsychology is both an approach (centering on the relationship between the brain and its output in the form of behaviour and thought) and a practice (involving neuropsychological assessments and rehabilitation). The latter is considered a specialization of Clinical Psychology, which means that one must be a clinical psychologist to be a clinical neuropsychologist. As said above, the University of Sussex unfortunately does not offer, at the moment, a formal PhD in clinical psychology or clinical neuropsychology. However, joining the **Reality Bending Lab** will get you well-prepared to eventually pursue this type of program, as the methods and mindset that we have draws heavily on neuropsychology (the use of neuropsychological tests, the focus on neurocognitive theories, etc.). In fact, some of our past members have become brilliant neuropsychologists, so feel free to ask them!
