I am taking new PhD students! **Send questions or CV to D.Makowski@sussex.ac.uk**.

## How to do a PhD in Psychology?

1. The first step is usually to contact the potential supervisor to discuss a rough research project outline. Write an email with your CV, your research interests and - if you have - some ideas for a research project that matches your supervisor's line of research. If you **don't have ideas yet**, it's perfectly fine! I will likely propose some avenues of research that might match your interest, and refine that down the line.
2. Once you have an in-principle approval, the next step is to get **funding**. There are usually 3 types of profiles: 1) the student and the supervisor come up with a research project, with which the student then applies to get some scholarship: 2) the supervisor already has a scholarship for a specific project that he obtained a grant for, and will recruit a PhD for that research project; 3) the student already secured a scholarship that allows them to pursue a PhD with the supervisor of their choice. However, funding is a tough topic, with many other possibilities and case-by-case considerations. Here are some opportunities:

- The [**South Coast Biosciences Network (SoCoBio)**](https://southcoastdtp.ac.uk/funding/) (UK and international students)


## Clinical Psychology PhD or DClinPsy

Unfortunately, the University of Sussex does not offer at the moment a PhD in 'Clinical Psychology' that would form part of the training to become a clinical psychologist. However, if you are interested in working with patients, it is entirely possible to have a research project that is tied to clinical populations, and become a "clinical" researcher. Some people
