### Self Control

Self control is a fascinating topic stemming out of millennia of philosophical and spiritual endeavours, related to fundamental questions pertaining to free-will, agency, responsibility, will and power. Self control is an umbrella term covering distinct aspects, such as **cognitive control** (and the so-called executive functions), **emotion regulation** or **phenomenological control** (the ability to modulate one's subjective experience). We are also particularly interested in the role of bodily states (e.g., the **cardiac phase**) in self-control.


### Neuroaesthetics and the Sublime

We are also interested in the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting aesthetic judgment and aesthetic experience, as well as more extreme states of consciousness such as Awe or the sublime (check-out [one of my favourite comic](https://existentialcomics.com/comic/18) on this topic).


### Fractal Organization

Complexity quantification (with concepts like non-linear dynamics, entropy, fractal dimensions) is a fascinating approach that we are exploring with neurophysiological signals (for instance with EEG or heart rate variability).
