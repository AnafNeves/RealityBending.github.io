## Our most recent publication is now out in *Entropy* 

Given the increasing use of complexity analysis in quantifying neural activity, and a rapidly growing body of complexity indices, we put [**NeuroKit2 Python Software**](https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/) to use, deriving recommendations for indices selection.

We compared the relationship and objective performance of 112 complexity indices based on:
- Computational weight
- Representativeness of a multidimensional space of latent dimensions
- Empirical proximity with other indices

We propose a selection of 12 indices, together representing 85.97% of total variance of all indices. The final selection includes *CWPEn, Line Length (LL), BubbEn, MSWPEn, MFDFA (Max), Hjorth Complexity, SVDEn, MFDFA (Width), MFDFA (Mean), MFDFA (Peak), MFDFA (Fluctuation), AttEn.* This study has attempted to empirically map the relationship between indices and provide information which may contribute to furthering reproducibility, replicability and clarity in the field.
