## NeuroKit2 0.1.5 is out! ðŸŽ‰

In the [latest 0.1.5 release](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit/releases/tag/v0.1.5) of *NeuroKit2*, our team has fixed several bugs in existing functionalities and in particular, expanded the support for computing complexity indices of neurophysiological signals. We added multiple new indices, including lyapunov exponents, hurst exponents, coalition entropy, and permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity to name a few!

Of course, the *NeuroKit2* Python package also includes tons of other useful features primarily devoted at physiological signal processing, which you can find out more about [**here**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit#quick-example)!

To understand more about complexity science, we recommend reading our [preprint](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit), which introduces the theoretical (and mathematical) meanings of complexity and reviews the existing studies of complexity analysis across multiple fields of psychology.

Watch our repo to keep a look out for more complexity functionalities coming up! :eyes:
