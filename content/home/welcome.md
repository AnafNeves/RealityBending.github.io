Exploring the neuropsychology of reality and its distortions

<sub>We are a small team led by [Dominique Makowski](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/) within the [Clinical Brain Lab](http://www.clinicalbrain.org/) in Singapore. We do research on reality perception, fake news, illusions, fiction, deception, self-control, and more, using EEG and physiological signals. We also develop open-source tools and software.</sub>
